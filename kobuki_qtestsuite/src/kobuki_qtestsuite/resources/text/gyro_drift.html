<h2>UP5 - Gyro Drift</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Estimates the gyro drift by checking against a turtlebot mounted kinect 
(fake laser) that is pointed at a wall</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Place the robot in front of a wall.</li>
  <li>Configure the rotational speed.</li>
  <li>Press start.</li>
  <li>Scan error angle (gyro vs laser) is plotted on the graph.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tips</h3>

<p>You might also want to open up rqt_gui with another plot window to view live the graphs of laser_scan_angle.scan_angle and gyro_scan_angle.scan_angle.</p>
